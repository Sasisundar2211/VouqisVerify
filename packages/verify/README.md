# Vouqis Verify

Verify every AI change before it reaches production.

Vouqis Verify runs automatically on every pull request that touches your AI code. It executes your existing evaluation suite, generates a deployment review, and comments on the PR so your team can make an informed merge decision.

## Vouqis Verify

## What Changed

| | |
|---|---|
| `prompts/` | ✓ 1 file changed |
| `src/agents/` | — no change |
| Evaluation | ✅ PASS |
| Duration | 4,231ms |
| Exit code | `0` |

## Recommendation

⚠️ MERGE WITH WARNING — Confidence: Medium

## Why

• Evaluation command completed successfully.
• AI behavior files changed — human review recommended.
• Existing tests cannot determine behavioral impact.

Changed: `prompts/system.txt`

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

**macOS**
```bash
brew install pipx && pipx install vouqis-verify
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)
```powershell
pip install pipx && pipx install vouqis-verify
```

> Do not use `pip3 install` or `python3 -m pip install` — on modern macOS these fail with a PEP 668 externally-managed-environment error. The commands above work on both platforms.
> Requires Python 3.11+ and Git.

### 2. Initialise

```bash
vouqis init
```

This creates a `vouqis.yml` in your current directory.

### 3. Configure

```yaml
# vouqis.yml
eval_command: pytest tests/eval/ -v   # any command — pytest, promptfoo, braintrust, custom script
baseline: main
ai_paths:
  - prompts/
  - src/agents/
  - config/models/
```

### 4. Add the GitHub Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vouqis-verify.yml
name: AI Change Verification

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Verify AI changes
        uses: Sasisundar2211/VouqisVerify/packages/verify@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it. Every PR that touches your AI paths now gets a deployment review.

```

Vouqis does **not** run your evals for you. It runs the command you already have. This means it works with any evaluation framework: pytest, promptfoo, braintrust, a custom shell script, or nothing at all — just exit 0 or exit 1.

## Configuration reference

```yaml
# eval_command: shell command to run your evaluations
#   exit 0  → PASS
#   exit 1+ → FAIL
eval_command: pytest tests/eval/ -v

# baseline: branch to compare against for detecting AI file changes
baseline: main

# ai_paths: directories or file prefixes that contain AI-related code
#   Only changes to these paths affect the confidence rating.
#   The eval command runs regardless.
ai_paths:
  - prompts/         # prompt templates
  - src/agents/      # agent workflow code
  - evals/           # evaluation suites
  - models/          # model configuration
  - rag/             # retrieval / RAG configuration
  - tools/           # tool integrations

# timeout_seconds: kill the eval command if it runs longer than this
timeout_seconds: 300

## Confidence levels

| Verdict | Confidence | When |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ SAFE TO MERGE | High | Eval passed, no AI files changed |
| ⚠️ MERGE WITH WARNING | Medium | Eval passed, AI files changed |
| ❌ BLOCK MERGE | High | Eval failed |

---

## Local testing

**macOS**
```bash
cd packages/verify
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
vouqis verify --no-comment
```

**Windows** (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd packages\verify
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
vouqis verify --no-comment
```

> **Windows:** If Activate.ps1 is blocked, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` once, then retry.
>
> **macOS:** If `python3 -m venv` fails, run `brew install python@3.11` first.

## Supported evaluation frameworks

Vouqis Verify runs any shell command via the OS default shell (`cmd.exe` on Windows, `sh` on macOS/Linux). Examples:

```yaml
# pytest (works on both platforms)
eval_command: pytest tests/eval/ -v

# promptfoo (works on both platforms)
eval_command: promptfoo eval --config promptfooconfig.yaml

# braintrust (works on both platforms)
eval_command: braintrust run evals/

# custom shell script — macOS/Linux only
eval_command: ./scripts/run-evals.sh

# custom batch script — Windows only
eval_command: scripts\run-evals.bat

# multiple steps (works on both platforms)
eval_command: pytest tests/unit/ && pytest tests/eval/
```

> **Windows note:** Shell scripts (`.sh`) require Git Bash or WSL. Use `.bat` files or `pytest` directly for native Windows support.
